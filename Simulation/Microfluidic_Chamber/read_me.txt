source code for the model in:
"Spatiotemporal Control of Immune Signaling by NF-kB dynamics"
Tino Frank*, Thomas Holst-Hansen*, Michael Junkin, Ala Trusina, Savas Tay

To compile the program, make the makefile "make_chamber.mak".
This creates an executable: chamber.
The executable runs a simulation of TNF diffusing through a chamber, and saves the data
as txt.-files to a DATA folder, which should be created in the same destination as the executable.

The main program is written in C++ and consists of a main file with diffusion and decay of TNF.
The cells are placed in a hexagonal grid which makes the boundary conditions dependendent on the size of the grid.
For the calculations to be correct there must be an even number of "Ycells".

The "Cell" class is defined in cell_chamber.h and cell_chamber.cpp.
Random numbers are generated by the Mersenne Twister which is a header file by Richard J. Wagner.

The data generated by the executable is processed by the matlab-file data_analysis.m.

sub_axis.m and Parse_Args.m are plotting functions from the matlab central and Realpeaks.m is used to find
local maxima.
